# Distributed Judge — A Local Distributed Computing Code Evaluation Platform

**Distributed Judge** is a lightweight simulation of an **online coding test platform** (like LeetCode or HackerRank) designed to demonstrate **core distributed computing concepts** in Python.

This project runs fully **locally** — no Docker, AWS, or Hadoop required — and shows how multiple distributed nodes can coordinate tasks, synchronize clocks, elect leaders, maintain replication consistency, and balance load in real-time.

## Features Implemented

| No. | Concept | Description |
|:---:|:---------|:-------------|
| 1️⃣ | **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)** | The backend exposes an XML-RPC style interface (`RMIServer`) that receives code submissions remotely and dispatches them to worker nodes. |
| 2️⃣ | **Multithreading** | Each node uses a thread pool to process multiple submissions concurrently, simulating a distributed code-execution environment. |
| 3️⃣ | **Clock Synchronization** | Implements a **Lamport logical clock** to maintain consistent event ordering across distributed evaluator nodes. |
| 4️⃣ | **Leader Election (Bully Algorithm)** | Nodes use the **Bully Election Algorithm** to elect a coordinator for control operations and metadata consistency. |
| 5️⃣ | **Data Consistency & Replication** | Problem/test data is replicated across nodes with eventual consistency — updates propagate automatically. |
| 6️⃣ | **Load Balancing & Failover** | Dynamic load distribution ensures each node gets fair workloads. If one node fails, its jobs are automatically rerouted to healthy nodes. |

          (Clock sync, replication,
           election, load balancing) 
```

Each node acts as a local microservice with its own port, queue, and heartbeat. The NodeManager oversees these nodes, performs leader election, and routes requests efficiently.

##  Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/distributed-judge.git
cd distributed-judge

2. Set up the backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt   # or install manually: streamlit, flask, etc.
python main_backend.py


This starts the RMI server on 127.0.0.1:9000 and worker nodes on ports 9101–9103.

3. Run the frontend

In a new terminal:

cd frontend
streamlit run app.py


The frontend UI will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501

## Demonstrations
✅ Basic Workflow

Launch the backend.

Open the Streamlit app.

Log in with any username.

Choose a coding problem (e.g., Two Sum, FizzBuzz).

Submit your Python solution.

The backend distributes, executes, and returns the result via RMI.

##  Failure & Recovery Simulation

Kill one node → backend detects failure via heartbeat.

Remaining nodes rebalance the load automatically.

When the node revives, it rejoins the cluster and resumes work.

##  Leader Election

During startup or node failure, the BullyElection algorithm triggers.

The node with the highest ID becomes the leader and handles replication duties.


## Distributed System Highlights

Fully local simulation of distributed computing principles.

Thread-safe execution model for job dispatching.

Automatic leader failover and recovery.

Clear visualization through Streamlit admin dashboard.

Excellent for education and demonstration of distributed systems.

##  Learning Outcomes

By studying or running this project, you’ll understand:

How distributed coordination works (leader election & synchronization)

How to manage consistency in replicated data

How real systems (like LeetCode/HackerRank) might architect their backend job evaluators

How to apply distributed algorithms practically using Python

##  Future Improvements

Add persistent storage (SQLite/Postgres) for submissions.

Integrate Docker containers for each node (optional).

Add real-time WebSocket logs to frontend.

Add multiple programming language support.
